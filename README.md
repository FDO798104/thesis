# NACEBEL Classification with Traditional vs. Transformer-Based Machine Learning

Welcome to the repository for the master's thesis project by Gil Coopmans and Ferre Dockx, exploring the comparison of traditional and transformer-based machine learning techniques for NACEBEL classification of Flemish company websites.
# Overview

This repository contains all the code used for data processing and model training. The code is available in two formats: Jupyter notebook files (.ipynb) and Python scripts (.py). However, please note that the Python scripts have not been extensively tested.
# Contents

    Website Scraper: Inside the **website_scraper folder**, you'll find the scraper used for collecting data from Flemish company websites.

    Code Notebooks: The **code_notebook_files folde**r contains Jupyter notebook files for data preprocessing and model development. We recommend using these files, as all code was developed and tested in Google Colab.

    Code Python Files: Alternatively, you can explore the **code_python_files folder**, which includes Python scripts equivalent to the notebook files. These scripts may require additional testing and adjustments for your specific environment.

# Getting Started

To get started, download the notebook files and open them using Google Colab. The notebook files include all necessary dependencies, and running them in colab will automatically set up the environment for you.

For the Python files, you'll need to ensure that the environment is correctly set up on your own. This may involve installing required libraries and ensuring compatibility with your system configuration.

We hope you find this repository useful.
